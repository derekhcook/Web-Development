                        <p>Hello! as you probably know by now my name is Derek Cook. I am a software developer currently located in Los Angeles California. 
                            Though I am not from here originally California has quickly become a home for me. With so much stuff to do here it is an amzing place to be.
                            Anyway enough about the city you want to get to know me! Well I am a small town Texas kid who has always had a desire to persue technology.
                            As a young kid I found myself taking things apart and rebuilding things with a dream to build robots. Eventually a friend and I tried to persue this 
                            dream by building remote controlled vehicles out of discarded toys and electronics we found in the old dump near our neighborhood. Soon into my highschool 
                            years though I realized I actually enjoyed other aspects of technology more than the mechanical side. During my highschool years I was 
                            introduced to programming in python by my engineering teacher. I fell in love with it, and wanted to program anything I could, but with college approaching 
                            I decided that it would be the best time to learn thins skill, so I set off to become a computer science major at Angelo State University. During my 
                            time at Angelo State I was not fortunate enough to get an internship in software development, but I did get a position in the schools IT department. 
                            With high hopes and big dreams I set the goal to learn as much as I could from the experience and worked my ass off. Eventually during this time I was
                            moved into the applications department where I ended up as the senior applications specialist overseeing the entirety of the campuses software assets.
                            It was also during this time that I was able to develope skills in scripting and automation. I was able to automate the IT infrastructure and improve on previous
                            automations to reduce the ticket turn over rate. After graduating in december of 2024 that is when I decided to start my journey with my girlfriend to Los Angeles.
                            With the idea of a new beginning and a 24 hour carr ride ahead I was excited to get going. Now that brings us to here. I am looking for a software development roll
                            and looking to build something extraordinary. So lets see where life takes me next.                    
                        </p>
